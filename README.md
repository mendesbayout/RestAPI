 #### Getting started

The purpose of this project is to present a simple solution for a Backend position in the company WORKALOVE. Feel Free to download & edit.

The Challenge was basically; as an admin(Cheff), CRUD receips. As an user, request for receips filtering by level of complexity or time consumed, and any other field. Well, as the position is for backend and I have few time; please make sure your user reads the documentation because his frontend is the Swagger itself, and the information he requests, will be in returned in JSON.
